Computer Vision Tools for interpretable features
### Clone this repo, run Image_Analysis_CSS.ipynb with jupyter notebook and follow the instructions

### Requirements:
* Python 2.7
* OPENCV: pip install opencv-python==3.3.0.10 (You should be able to use 4, too)
* Tensorflow: pip install tensorflow==1.14.0 (I have 1.12 but this should work too)
* Google Vision API: pip install google-cloud-vision
* Numpy/Math/Matplotlib (probably you have them already)


### Alina notes:

* Environment: mViz
* Python 3.5 (since need tensorflow on 3.5 for Windows)
* Don't have Face++ working yet since needs different version of Python
* Use data in Wellness_Images
